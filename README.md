## Introduction

In this project, we have tested the **Flight Search Application** API using two different approaches: Rest-Assured library and Postman.

### Using Postman Collection

For testing the API using Postman, you can utilize the Postman collection provided in the `postman` directory. Detailed instructions on how to import and use the collection can be found in the [Postman README](./postman/README.md) located in the `postman` directory.

### Using Rest-Assured Tests

If you prefer testing the API using the Rest-Assured library, you can explore the tests located in the `rest-assured` directory. Instructions on how to set up and run these tests can be found in the [Rest-Assured README](./rest-assured/README.md) located in the `rest-assured` directory.
